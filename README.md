OOP in Java – Strings and Arrays
Name: IMANE MEKKAOUI 
Class: 1-SDIA 

This repository contains Java solutions for the practical work on Strings and Arrays. It includes four exercises focusing on array manipulation, string processing, and menu-driven applications.

### Exercise 1: Student Grades Management
### Problem Description
The goal is to write a Java program that stores student grades in an array and performs the following operations:
Sort and display the list of grades.
Calculate and display the average grade.
Identify the highest and lowest grades.
Search for a specific grade and display how many students achieved it.
### The operations include:
1. Sorting grades in ascending order
2. Calculating the average grade
3. Identifying the minimum and maximum grades
4. Searching for a specific grade and counting how many students obtained it
### Key Concepts Used:
- Arrays for storing numerical data
- Scanner for reading user input
- Loops for data processing
- Use of Java utility methods for sorting

### Exercise 2: First Group Verb Conjugation

### Problem
The program reads a French verb of the first group and displays its conjugation in the present tense.

### Solution
This program works with French verbs of the first group (verbs ending with “-er”).
The user enters a verb, and the program verifies whether it belongs to the first group. If valid, the verb is conjugated in the present tense.
The program removes the suffix “er” and adds the correct endings for each personal pronoun.
### Operations Included
1- Validation of verb type
2- Root extraction
3- Present tense conjugation
### Key Concepts Used
-String manipulation
-Conditional logic
-User input handling

## Exercise 3: String Operations Menu
### Problem
The program provides a menu to perform operations on a string:
> Enter a string
> Display it
> Reverse it
> Count the number of words
### Solution
A menu is implemented using `switch`.  
`StringBuilder` is used to reverse the string.  
The number of words is calculated using `split()`.

### Operations Included
1- Entering a string
2- Displaying the string
3- Reversing the string
4- Counting the number of words
### Key Concepts Used
- Menu-based programming
- Loops and switch statements
- String manipulation techniques
### Execution

### Exercise 4:
### Problem
The program counts the occurrences of each alphabet letter in a string, without distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase letters.

### Solution
A 26-element integer array is used.  
Each character is converted to uppercase and counted using its alphabetical index.

### Operations Included
1- Case normalization
2- Letter frequency counting
3- Displaying results
### Key Concepts Used
- Character processing
- Arrays as counters
- Iterative traversal of strings
